Recovery Manager Central

From Nov 2015 to Present 

PyCharm, NetBeans, Visual studio code 

Role Played & contribution 

Analyze and architect the requirement into deliverable projects. 

Participating along-with the active development (with React Js), take responsibility to handle any project specific hurdles such as configuring and maintaining the project file/folder structure, checking the code standard, focusing on unit test and integration test script, build project and integrating the unit test script into GitHub, maintaining the documentation etc. are the part of my current role and responsibility. 

Description 

HPE Recovery Manager Central (RMC) software integrates HPE primary storage with HPE secondary storage to facilitate the backup of customer data into much less costly storage devices and give access to recovery when necessary. It provides you with application-managed data protection that speeds and simplifies data protection on your storage Array, while bypassing traditional backup server-based processes. 

Mono-repo and micro-service-based architecture help us work in small teams independently and deliver it faster. We use Eslint rules integrated with VScode to identify the small syntax related issues faster. Typescripts helps us avoid many future bugs upfront.  

We prefer test driven development. Every method written is as small as possible to make it unit testable. Before development, we find common pieces of modules and move them to a common section that can be reused. We use React with Grommet that gives us most of the core components to integrate with our project. However, any component that are not fit for our need, we customize it or build a scratch component and move those in a directory called Core that is sharable with entire project/s. We maintain a Storybook to list out all such custom components so that new developer can quickly adopt. I had a great experience with a new developer who got accustomed to our team very quickly with the help of the process flow that we maintain in our project.  

Once a feature is complete, we/developer writes the preliminary automation scripts to capture any test scenario that cannot be done with Unit tests. Later automation engineers extended it to full fledge. Cypress is a great tool that helps us write automation scripts. We try to maintain a good coverage report (70% but this is not hard-core rule as we feel coverage report is not that define the code quality). 

We maintain our own antifactory separate from NPM which helps us avoid any unexpected results (server unreachable, unexpected package update). We always maintain package updates in 3-6 months duration.  

I am also involved in integrating CI-CD pipeline to automate the build and test process. Every commit into GitHub gone through a CI flow which does linting checks, unit tests etc. Then only it merges with feature branch. After that automation scripts run. If successful, a build generates and deploys to a specified server for QA testing.  

I participate actively in code review and active training process. And try to get in-depth knowledge of the technologies that interested me.

Database design, Planning, and development 

Description 

This is a User-friendly Hotel Management System with a strong front end graphically displayed reservation panel which is a quick way to check room status and book rooms (drag mouse for booking). Multiple Hotels can be managed by this system and multiple users can access this system concurrently. The system also has laundry management and Restaurant management system as an added feature. The most important advantage of this software is rooms can be booked at ones having span between dates. That’s mean if someone wants to book rooms having gaps between dates (i.e., 1 room on 23rd April, 2 rooms on 25th April and 1 room on 29th April), only a single reservation can fulfill this task.
